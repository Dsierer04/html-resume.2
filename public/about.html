<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 19 years old. I enjoy hunting, fishing, 
  and learning new things. My love for the outdoors stems from my grandpa.
  He introduced me into the outdoor at a young age and I have developed a deep love and appreciation 
  for anything outdoors related. 
  My most recent venture is web development. 
  I am still, what most consider, a complete beginner; 
  However, I look to expand my arsenal of knowledge everyday!</p>
